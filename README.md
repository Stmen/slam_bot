# slam_bot
SLAM mapping and navigation simulation project

 In this SLAM Mapping and Navigation Simulation Project, there are three main parts, which are
 - Construction of models and environments
 - Location and navigation based on known maps
 - Map building and navigation using RTAB-MAP
 
 The **slam_bot_initial** folder provides the initial slam_bot package,if you want to build model by yourself,this is good choice!
